###Boostrap-slideshow

By [Nic Lindh](http://niclindh.com)

Simple css styling of the carousel component of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) to make it look more like a traditional slideshow. This means moving the caption and location indicators below the image and removing the gradients from the left and right edges.

Also, the caption field is fixed-height to avoid unsightly jumping of the carousel triggers caused by varying caption lengths. The caption field gets more height on phone size screens to compensate for the column being narrower.

While simple, I'm putting this up in the hope it might save somebody else some time.

All the action is in ```css/s.css```.

Includes an example HTML file and images.

Improvements are welcome.
